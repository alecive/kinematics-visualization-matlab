function [chain] = FwdKin(body_part)
% This function computes and displays the forward kinematics of a body part
% INPUT
%   body_part (struct) - the body part under consideration. Each body part has the same structure:
%     name = the name of the body_part;
%     H0   = is the roto-translation matrix in the origin of the chain (if the body part is attached
%            to another one, tipically the last reference frame of the previous body part goes here)
%     H_0  = is the roto-translation matrix used internally for some special stuff (for example in
%            fingers). It's attached after H0 and it shouldn't be modified by the user. Most of the
%            time, it can be an identity matrix.
%     DH   = it's the parameter matrix. Each row has 4 DH parameters (a, d, alpha, offset), thus each
%            row completely describes a link. The more rows are added, the more links are attached.
%     Th   = it's the joint values vector (as read from the encoders)
%  Please note that everything is in SI units (the eventual conversions will be handled by
%  the algorithm itself).
%
% OUTPUT
%   chain (struct) - the resulted chain with everything inside it. It's divided by body parts.
