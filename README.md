# kinematics-visualization-matlab

This is a legacy repo with the scripts I did to visualize the iCub upperbody kinematics in Matlab. It might come useful in multiple ways in the future.

To see what the software is capable of, simply run (in Matlab) the following:

```
iCubUpperBodyFwdKin(1,1,1,1,1)
```

The result will be something like this, with the torso, arms and hands of the iCub humanoid robot.
